## My process
I started Building The Design on Phone it was normal and easy
But Once I started Coding it for Large Screen sizes I face 
A lot of Challenges Like for example:
1 - Making Sure The Rating Boxes doesn't cause scroll and the Writing inside doesn't screw up due to size screen changing.
2 - Using Flexbox sometimes seems difficult than it's and it got nice features that I didn't notice until I've gone       through the problem of doing the rating Boxes.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Flexbox
- Mobile-first Approach

### What I learned

Setting Max width and min width on some elements sometime can be very beneficial 
When I did the Design On the large screen I noticed the importance of Container Wrapping the Elements.

### Continued development

I just want to know the proper approach to position the Rating Boxes That's what I am curious about.
